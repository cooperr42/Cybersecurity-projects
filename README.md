# Cybersecurity-projects

A collection of cybersecurity data analysis and visualization projects using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and industry datasets such as the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) and CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities).

## Project: Vulnerability Analysis for 2022-2025

### Overview
This project processes large JSON datasets from the National Vulnerability Database and CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, cleans and normalizes them into Pandas DataFrames, and produces interactive visualizations to identify trends in vulnerabilities.

### Key Features
- **Data ingestion & parsing**: JSON â†’ normalized Pandas DataFrames
- **Data cleaning**: handling nested fields, missing values, and large datasets
- **Visualizations**:
  - Vulnerabilities over time
  - Severity distribution (CVSS scores)
  - Vendor/product breakdowns
  - Exploited vulnerabilities trends
- **Interactive dashboards** using Plotly for exploration
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control**: Git + Git LFS for large files
